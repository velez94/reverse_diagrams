## Technical Details

### Architecture

The explorer is built with a clean, modular architecture:

- **Data Loader**: Loads and integrates JSON data from multiple sources
- **Navigation Engine**: Manages navigation state and history
- **Display Manager**: Handles terminal rendering with rich formatting
- **Controller**: Orchestrates all components and user interaction

### Data Requirements

**Required:**
- `diagrams/json/organizations_complete.json` (generated by `reverse_diagrams -o`)

**Optional (graceful degradation):**
- `diagrams/json/account_assignments.json` (generated by `reverse_diagrams -i`)
- `diagrams/json/groups.json` (generated by `reverse_diagrams -i`)

### Testing

Comprehensive test coverage with **103 tests**:

- **23 Property-Based Tests**: Using hypothesis library with 100+ iterations each
  - Organization tree structure integrity
  - Data integration completeness
  - Navigation state transitions
  - Breadcrumb accuracy
  - Display formatting
  - Pagination and responsiveness

- **75 Unit Tests**: Testing individual components
  - Data models validation
  - Data loader functionality
  - Navigation engine logic
  - Display manager rendering
  - Controller orchestration

- **5 Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows
  - Complete navigation flow
  - Graceful degradation
  - Error handling
  - Deep navigation (5+ levels)
  - Large organizations (60+ accounts)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate the required data first
reverse_diagrams -p my-profile -o -i -r us-east-1

# Launch the interactive explorer
reverse_diagrams watch --explore
```

### Custom JSON Directory

```bash
# Use a custom directory for JSON files
reverse_diagrams watch --explore --json-dir /path/to/json
```

### Example Workflow

1. Start the explorer: `reverse_diagrams watch --explore`
2. Select an organizational unit from the root view
3. Browse accounts and nested OUs within that OU
4. Select an account to view its IAM Identity Center assignments
5. See permission sets, groups, and users with full details
6. Navigate back to explore other parts of your organization
7. Exit when done

## Graceful Degradation

The explorer continues to work even with missing optional data:

- **Missing `account_assignments.json`**: Accounts shown without assignment information
- **Missing `groups.json`**: Group membership details not available
- Clear messages inform you about missing data

## Error Handling

The explorer provides helpful error messages:

- **Missing required files**: Shows exact file path and how to generate it
- **Invalid JSON**: Displays parsing errors with file location
- **Empty organizations**: Shows helpful message about data collection

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a new feature that doesn't affect existing functionality.
